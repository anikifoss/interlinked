# Interlinked

Interlinked is an asynchronous framework for agentic code generation with LLMs.

The project is written in Scala using pekko for back-pressure mechanism to facilitate incremental code delivery.

# State

The project is in very early stages. It started as a workspace to formalize ad-hoc python scripts used for [vibe-games-oss](https://github.com/anikifoss/vibe-games-oss). Despite its origins, Interlinked is intended to be a generic purpose code generation engine rather than focusing solely on games.
